What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge merges two Git branches but keeps the logs of the commits on each branch the same.

A rebase does essentially the same thing as merge but instead modifies the logs of commits once the rebase is complete.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a repository hosted on the internet as opposed to your local machine. This allows others to see the changes.
